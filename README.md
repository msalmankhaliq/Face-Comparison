# Face-Comparison

Using the face_recognition API, we can compare two or more faces with each other and based on the similarity score, the model will classify if the faces are of the same person or not.

## Applications

Face comparison models have a wide range of applications in the real life and can be used in any place/system where the goal is to detect the similar faces or to verify the face of the same person or in short face recognition. 

## Code Requirements 

The example code is in Python (version 3.6 or higher will work)

## Dependencies

1) import cv2
2) import imutils
